#Greedy Algorihtms

This file has some greedy approaches to solve some common problems.

--In Activity Selection problem, we have jobs with start and end time and we need to perform maximum number of jobs. 
If one job's time interval overlaps with any other job's interval, only one of them can be formed.
  
--In fractional knapsack problem, we have a bag and some items with given value and weight, the bag has fixed weight capacity and we need to 
maximise value in the bag. The items cam be put in the bag in fractions.

--Job sequencing problem has certain jobs with their deadlines and profit on each job, each job takes 1 unit of time, we start work from time 
0 and try to complete jobs such that we have maximum profit
