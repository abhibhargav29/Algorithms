#Dynamic Programming

This file has some common DP solvable problems.
--LCS is Longest Common subsequence problem, given two strings, we need to find the longest subsequence between them. A subsequence is formed by picking 
  0 or more characters in order from a string or an array.
--In Coin change problem we have some given coins and a sum and we need to find number of ways that sum can be obtained.
--Edit distance problem has two strings and we need to find minimum total operations that should be done to convert str1 to str2. Operation can be  deletion, 
  insertion or replacing of a charcter.
--In LIS problem, we have an array and we need to print Longest increasing subsequence in it. It is solved with DP as well as divide and conqer.
--Min Coins problem has an array of coins and we need to make a value form them using minimum coins.
--Min jumps problem gives us an array and we need to find in how many min jumps we can reach from 0th index to last index, Where we start from 0 and when on an
  index we can make jumps to (index, index + arr[index]) cells.
--0/1 Knapsack problem is same as the fractional knapsack except that now we can only put an item or not put it, no fractions allowed.
--Card Game
--Egg Dropping
--BST count
--Subset sum
--Matrix chain multiplication
