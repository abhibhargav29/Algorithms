#Dynamic Programming

This file has some common DP solvable problems. These are LCS, edit distance and coin change problems.
--LCS is Longest Common subsequence problem, given two strings, we need to find the longest subsequence between them. 
  A subsequence is formed by picking 0 or more characters in order from a string or an array.
--In Coin change problem we have some given coins and a sum and we need to find number of ways that sum can be obtained.
--Edit distance problem has two strings and we need to find minimum total operations that should be done to convert str1 to str2.
  Operation can be deletion, insertion or replacing of a charcter.
